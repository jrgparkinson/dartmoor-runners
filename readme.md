# Dartmoor Runners website

The current series is described in the `current.markdown` file.

When the series ends, move this file to the `_previous_series` folder with a name like `2023winter.md` (make sure it starts with the year so that we can order these pages correctly), and update `current.markdown` to describe the new series.
